  ## Contributing
  Contributes are more than welcome! Just send me over an email with your contact info and ideas to make this project better.

  ## Tests
  Once you've started the program and have it up in the browser, you'll go ahead and use the username SunnyScribe and the password password. This will give you access to the pre exsisting filler patient data and allow you access to the whole system.

  I'd like to give credit to my Med Friends and to the show Scrubs for the inspiration. The application itself was made with the help of CoPilot and Stack Overflow.
